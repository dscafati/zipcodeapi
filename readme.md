# Location to ZipCode API - JQuery ZipCode Autocompletion #

This is a sample web project of how to implement a zip code autocomplete field.
 
The user starts writing a city name or zip code (postal code) and then a tooltip shows up with the matching cities.

This sample is only for US cities

THE SERVER NEEDS **PHP** TO RUN

```bash
   bower install
   ``` 


## Running the demo ##
You can run this demo using the php built-in server:

   php -S localhost:8081
   ``` 

And then open http://localhost:8081 in your browser
    
## Customization ##

The data comes from a csv file downloaded from here: http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/

The data is sent as a plain JSON document back and forth, implementing security strategies is up to yo.

We are using this plugin for the form autocompletion:
